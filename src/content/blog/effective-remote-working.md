I have been working remotely for some time now. Here, I summarize my insights on how to make remote work both effective and efficient. 💪🏻

## Communicating Effectively 💬
- Verbal communication can easily be overlooked. Record important meeting notes in a Google Doc for future reference.
- Opt for communication via video calls rather than voice calls. Human expressions foster greater openness and mutual trust. 🤝
- Write clearly to communicate effectively with your co-workers. Time and space are significant barriers in remote work.
- Prefer posting work-related communication in **open/team channels** rather than **1-1 chats**. This keeps everyone informed and prevents confusion.

## Sharing Publicly 👐
- Share as much as possible about your tasks publicly.
- Update a task's status before starting and after completing it.
- Openly share blockers so they can be promptly addressed by colleagues.
- Sharing your learnings can help clear someone else's blockers. Group learning is exponential in nature.

## Working Style 💻
- Analyze 📈 a task before investing time in it.
- Write your analysis in a **structured manner** to help communicate your thoughts clearly and lucidly.
- Use a tool like [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) to jot down your thoughts and share them with fellow developers.
- It also serves as a knowledge base for any similar future tasks.
- Designing a quick prototype, for instance in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), ensures that other stakeholders (developers, scrum masters, clients) are aligned, thus avoiding rework.
- Cross-referencing resources on GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket issues provides more context to the problem. Link issues, designs, analysis documents, or even screenshots to the issue.
- Include a **before** / **after** screenshot of the changes (➕/➖) made in a Merge Request/Pull Request.
