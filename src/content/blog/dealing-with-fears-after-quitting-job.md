excerpt: "From Comfort Zone to Growth Zone: My Journey of Quitting a 9-5 Job"

It has been about five months since I left my comfortable job. During this time, I have learned a lot by building products. However, the two most important lessons I've learned for leading a better life are escaping the `9-5 job` mentality and the `monthly salary` mindset.

Learning these things was not easy and came with its own challenges. Almost every day starts with the same thoughts about survival, security, and earning money. Even early humans or cavemen experienced this daily. Back then, it was primarily about survival. With no house, no technology, and no money, the questions that would have circulated in the minds of those primates would have been:

1. How will I gather food today?
2. Will I get enough food to feed my family?
3. Will I be able to hunt that pack of animals I missed yesterday?
4. I shouldn't have been greedy while hunting and should have been content with at least what I was getting yesterday.

Some other related thoughts would have been:

* Hope that our tribe can continue to live in this place for some more time.
* Hope that we won't be attacked today by wild animals.
* Hope that we won't be attacked today by members of other tribes.

Without a fixed, secure monthly salary, similar thoughts resonate in my mind about modern life since I left my job. These thoughts are a direct result of our evolution from primates. The duration of modern life is orders of magnitude less than our total time on Earth. As a result, these thoughts have been engraved into our psychology and even into our culture.

These thoughts get triggered and peak every time we feel deprived of something. However, I have observed that it's possible to gradually decrease the intensity of these 'survival' thoughts. The trick to subside these thoughts is to focus on the positive things that have happened since, which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

We can never completely rid ourselves of these inner demons. We just need to rise above them. Once you think about that, you realize that it's okay if a particular outcome didn't occur as expected. One should always think about the big hunt that is possible the next day.
